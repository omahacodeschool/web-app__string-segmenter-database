Add a working String Segmenter to this **/lib** directory.

Then find a way (using `require` or `require_relative`) to reference that file in **controllers/main_controller.rb**.

If you accomplish that much, then you should be able to utilize the String Segmenter in that file's controller actions.

**Important Note:** If you do any amount of substantial work on the String Segmenter itself, _then you are doing this assignment incorrectly_. This purpose of this assignment is not to fix or refactor your String Segmenter. It is to use a working version of it, whether it's your own or not, in the context of a Web application.

---

Don't worry about adding tests for the String Segmenter itself. You _do_ need to write _acceptance tests_, similar to the tests in the previous Web toy problem. But don't worry about copying over the tests from the String Segmenter.

---

If you want a working String Segmenter to use for this assignment but don't have one your own, ask your classmates if they'll share theirs. (Again, this assignment is not about making String Segmenter. It's about _using existing programs_ within a web application.)
